## REACT-Restaurant

Built using REACT, Javascript, JSON, NPM, HTML and CSS

There are 2 folders here

#### The first one is react-website   
It contains the entire frontend of the restaurant built on react framework.
Depending on the package manager you use you use either npm start or yarn start to run the react app.

#### The second is my JSON server that serves my react website with resources or data.
To run it on your local system use json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000
